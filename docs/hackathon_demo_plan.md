# 🎯 Hackathon Demo Plan — Agile Coach Agent

## Demo Overview

**Pitch (30 seconds):** "We built an AI-powered Agile Coach that doesn't just take notes in your retrospective — it *learns across sprints*, suggests what your team should discuss before the meeting even starts, and follows up to make sure action items actually get done. It plugs into Slack and email via MCP so the coaching never stops between meetings."

**Demo Duration:** ~8 minutes (expandable to 12 if judges ask for deep dives)

## Mock Data Setup — Expanded Sprint History

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The current database seeds **3 sprints** (22, 23, 24). To tell a compelling multi-sprint story, we need **5 sprints** that show a clear narrative arc — a team that starts struggling, gets coached, and improves.

### Sprint Data — The Story Arc

| Sprint | Name | Dates | Committed | Completed | Issues | Completed | Blocked | Trend | Velocity | Blockers |
|--------|------|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|-----------|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Sprint 1** | Sprint 1 — Primary Structure & Reactor Ring | Jun 29 – Jul 10 | 34 | 22 | 12 | 7 | 4 | behind trend | 22 | "Conflicting design revisions on reactor support ring, Nonconforming hardware lot from secondary supplier (suspect fasteners)" |
| **Sprint 2** | Sprint 2 — Superlaser Control & Reactor Shielding | Jul 13 – Jul 24 | 32 | 26 | 11 | 8 | 3 | behind trend | 26 | "Superlaser firing control timing synchronization fault, Dual-zone exhaust vent blockage thermal risk" |
| **Sprint 3** | Sprint 3 — Emergency Heat Sinks & Exhaust Audit | Jul 27 – Aug 07 | 38 | 35 | 12 | 11 | 1 | on trend | 35 | "Exhaust port structural collar inspection delays" |
| **Sprint 4** | Sprint 4 — Operational Readiness & Infiltration Testing | Aug 10 – Aug 21 | 40 | 29 | 14 | 10 | 3 | behind trend | 32 | "Auxiliary corridor access security breach, Unapproved exhaust collar thickness shortcuts" |

**The narrative:** Sprint 1 was rough (65% completion, 4 blockers due to suspect hardware). Sprint 2 improved slightly as supplier controls took effect, but revealed thermal vent weaknesses. Sprint 3 completed major heat-sink installation but left collar audits pending. Sprint 4 regressed — auxiliary corridor infiltration occurred during load testing — which is the sprint we'll run the live retro analysis on. The coach detects the pattern and suggests topics accordingly.

### Sample Retro Transcript (for Sprint 4 Live Demo)

Use this transcript for the live analysis. It's realistic, contains multiple speakers, discusses blockers, and includes both explicit action items and things the AI coach should pick up on:

```
Darth Sidious: Welcome, everyone. Sprint 4 retrospective. The station is nearly operational, which historically is when everything goes wrong. Health of the project?

Darth Vader: Reactor shielding reached ninety-one percent last sprint. Construction crews exceeded goals. However, the auxiliary corridor security breach during penetration testing exposed a weakness we had not anticipated.

Darth Sidious: Wonderful. Ninety-one percent protected and the remaining nine percent is apparently a guided tour for Rebel commandos.

Grand Admiral Thrawn: Logistics remained stable. Supply routes were uninterrupted and we have thirty days of consumable inventory staged. The completion risk forecast shows we are recoverable if shielding closes this sprint.

General Grievous: Droid workforce uptime exceeded ninety-nine percent. However, contractor shortcuts on exhaust port reinforcement collars created three separate structural findings. Two were not caught by the normal inspection process.

Darth Sidious: Contractors again. At this point I am genuinely curious whether they are incompetent or actively assisting the Rebellion. Either way, the outcome is identical.

Darth Maul: The red team reached an auxiliary reactor-control corridor through a maintenance route before being intercepted. They came within two security barriers of critical systems. After remediation, the hardened corridor resisted the repeat attempt, but the initial success is concerning.

Darth Vader: We added blast doors, physical barriers, and restricted segmentation. The engineering changes preserve maintenance and emergency access.

Darth Sidious: Good. What about the exhaust port situation? I have developed what I believe is a reasonable anxiety about exhaust architecture.

General Grievous: All three nonconforming collars have been restored to approved design thickness and passed structural inspection. But the fact that contractors deviated from controlled drawings without detection suggests our inspection gates need strengthening.

Grand Admiral Thrawn: I recommend mandatory dual-sign-off on any structural modification in exhaust-adjacent sections. The pattern of unauthorized changes is the real risk, not any single collar.

Darth Sidious: Excellent suggestion. Thrawn, implement that control.

Darth Maul: I also recommend we run a final comprehensive security review — physical and cyber — before we declare operational readiness. The infiltration test proved our remediation works, but we have not tested the full station perimeter since the corridor hardening.

Darth Vader: Agreed. We should combine the final security review with the remaining shielding acceptance testing. One integrated operational readiness exercise.

Darth Sidious: Very good. Immediate actions: close the final shielding, implement the dual-sign-off inspection control, run the integrated readiness exercise, and stop the contractors from treating engineering drawings as creative suggestions. Meeting adjourned.

## Step-by-Step Demo Walkthrough

### 🎬 Act 1: The Setup (1 minute)

**What you say:**
> "Let me show you what happens before, during, and after a retrospective with our Agile Coach Agent. I'm going to walk you through a real team scenario — the Death Star II engineering team finishing Sprint 4."

**What you do:**
1. Open the app → Navigate to the **Retrospectives** section
2. Show the **project dropdown** — select "Death Star II Construction"
3. Quickly show the **Action Items** tab with some existing tracked actions (from prior sprints)
4. Point out: *"Notice we already have some carried-over actions from previous sprints. The coach remembers these."*

---

### 🎬 Act 2: Pre-Retro Intelligence (2 minutes)

**What you say:**
> "Before the retro even starts, the coach analyzes sprint metrics and suggests what the team should talk about."

**What you do:**
1. Click **"New Retrospective"** button → Intake modal opens
2. Select **Sprint 24 — Payments** from the sprint dropdown
3. Point out the sprint metrics shown inline: *"29 out of 40 committed points, 3 blockers, behind trend. The coach sees all of this."*
4. Click **"Suggest Topics"** button in the **Coach Suggested Agenda** section
5. Wait for the AI to generate 3–5 topics (or if offline, the fallback topics will populate)
6. Walk through the suggested topics:
   - *"Sprint Blocker Resolution & PR Review Delays"* — metric-driven, priority 1
   - *"Capacity Planning & Commitment vs Completion Gap"* — the team committed 40 but delivered 29
   - *"Carried-Over Action Item Follow-Through"* — items from past sprints that haven't been closed
7. **Accept 2 topics** by clicking "Accept Topic" buttons
8. Point out: *"The team can accept, dismiss, or add their own topics. This becomes the coaching agenda."*

**Key judge talking point:** *"The coach doesn't just blindly suggest topics — it uses sprint metrics, historical blockers, and carried-over actions to generate contextually relevant discussion items."*

---

### 🎬 Act 3: Transcript Analysis (2 minutes)

**What you say:**
> "Now the retro happens. The team discusses, and afterward someone uploads the transcript. Let me drop in a real conversation."

**What you do:**
1. **Paste the sample transcript** (from above) into the transcript textarea
2. Show the model status indicator (e.g., "Google Gemini" or "Qwen2.5 7B local")
3. Click **"Analyze retrospective"**
4. Show the **live progress bar** as chunks are processed: *"It's processing the transcript in chunks, extracting both explicit action items the team stated, and coach-suggested improvements they might have missed."*
5. Wait for analysis to complete → **Review modal** opens automatically

---

### 🎬 Act 4: Action Item Review (1.5 minutes)

**What you say:**
> "The agent extracts two types of action items — things the team explicitly committed to, and coaching suggestions based on patterns it detected."

**What you do:**
1. Show the **proposal cards** — highlight the difference between:
   - 🟢 **Explicit** actions (things the team said): "Run gateway review onboarding session" (Owner: Jordan), "Establish 24-hour PR review SLA", "Implement config drift detection" (Owner: Marcus)
   - 🤖 **Coach** suggestions: items the AI inferred from patterns (e.g., "Address flaky CI test suite stability")
2. **Accept 3–4 proposals** → Show them being converted into tracked action items with owners and time estimates
3. Point out: *"Each action item gets an owner, an estimate, and can be exported as a mock Jira ticket."*
4. Click **"Create Jira Ticket"** on one item → show the AGILE-XXXX key generated

---

### 🎬 Act 5: Notifications Tab (1.5 minutes)

**What you say:**
> "The coach doesn't stop when the meeting ends. We've built a complete notification system that keeps the team accountable."

**What you do:**
1. Navigate to the **Notifications** tab
2. Show the **Integration Connections** panel:
   - Slack integration with Channel ID and MCP Project ID
   - Email integration with sender address
3. Walk through the **6 notification triggers** — scroll through each:
   - **Pre-Retro Topic Preview** → *"24 hours before the retro, the team gets the coaching agenda via Slack"*
   - **Action Item Owner Reminders** → *"Jordan would get a DM: 'You own 2 open items going into Sprint 25'"*
   - **Sprint Metric Alerts** → *"When velocity drops 20%, the team gets notified immediately"*
   - **Post-Retro Personal Summaries** → *"After analysis, each person gets their own action items via DM"*
   - **Mid-Sprint Action Follow-Up** → *"Halfway through the sprint, owners get a check-in"*
   - **Coach Insight Share** → *"When the coach detects a pattern — like PR delays recurring in 3 of 4 sprints — it shares with the team"*
4. Show the **Slack/Email channel toggle** on one item — switch it from Slack to Email
5. Click **"Test"** on the Pre-Retro Topic Preview → show the test dispatch in the delivery log

**Key judge talking point:** *"Each notification type can be independently toggled, routed to Slack or Email, and test-triggered. This uses MCP to connect to actual Slack workspaces."*

---

### 🎬 Act 6: Insights Dashboard (1 minute)

**What you say:**
> "Over time, the coach builds up intelligence about the team's patterns. Let me show you what it's learned."

**What you do:**
1. Navigate to the **Insights** tab
2. Show the **Retro Effectiveness Score** (e.g., 72/100) with the info tooltip
3. Walk through the **3 Active Coach Insights**:
   - 🟡 **PR Review Bottleneck Pattern** (88% confidence) — *"This appeared in 3 of the last 4 sprints"*
   - 🟣 **Action Item Completion Arc** (92% confidence) — *"Completion improved from 40% to 75%"*
   - 🔵 **Testing & QA Blind Spot** (Coach Recommendation) — *"30% of blockers are test-related but it's never been a retro topic"*
4. Show the **Key Retrospective Metrics**: Topic Coverage (86%), Speaker Balance (82%), Action Follow-Through (78%)
5. Point out: *"These metrics are computed from actual transcript analysis and action tracking, not self-reported."*

**Key judge talking point:** *"The coach learns across sprints. It's not just a one-shot transcript analyzer — it builds persistent memory and gets smarter over time."*

---

### 🎬 Closing (30 seconds)

**What you say:**
> "To summarize: our Agile Coach Agent operates in a continuous feedback loop. It prepares the team before the retro, analyzes the conversation after, tracks follow-through mid-sprint, and learns from every cycle. It uses MCP to connect to Slack and email for real-time notifications. Everything runs locally — transcripts and team data never leave the machine."

## Mock Data Code Changes Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are the specific code changes needed in [`retroRepository.js`](file:///Users/mike/WebstormProjects/openwhispr/src/helpers/retroRepository.js) to add the 2 additional sprints.

### Add Sprint 20 and Sprint 21

Insert two additional `stmt.run(...)` calls after the existing Sprint 22 seed (line 151), inside the `if (count.c === 0)` block:

```javascript
// Sprint 21 — Onboarding (slight improvement from Sprint 20)
stmt.run(
  "sprint-21",
  "Sprint 21 — Onboarding",
  "2026-06-10",
  "2026-06-21",
  32,
  26,
  11,
  8,
  3,
  "behind trend",
  26,
  "Onboarding flow QA handoff delays, Flaky integration test suite still intermittent"
);

// Sprint 20 — Onboarding (the rough start)
stmt.run(
  "sprint-20",
  "Sprint 20 — Onboarding",
  "2026-05-27",
  "2026-06-07",
  34,
  22,
  12,
  7,
  4,
  "behind trend",
  22,
  "CI pipeline flaky tests blocking merges, Unclear ownership on onboarding API endpoints"
);
```

### Database Reset Required

Since sprint seeding only runs when the table is empty, you'll need to delete the existing database file to re-seed:

```bash
# Find and delete the existing retro database to trigger a re-seed
rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/openwhispr/retro.db
```

Then restart the app — migrations will recreate the tables and seed all 5 sprints.

---

## Reset Demo Data Button (In-App)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Instead of manually deleting the database file and restarting the app between demo runs, add a **"Reset Demo Data"** button directly on the Retrospectives screen so you can reset to a clean slate with one click.

### What It Does

1. **Drops and re-creates** all retro-related tables (`retrospectives`, `retro_proposals`, `retro_tracked_actions`, `coach_topics`, `coach_topic_outcomes`, `coach_insights`, `coach_slack_messages`)
2. **Re-seeds** the 5 mock sprints (Sprint 20–24) and the default "General Engineering" project
3. **Pre-seeds complete retrospective records for Sprints 20, 21, and 22**:
   - Realistic meeting transcripts with multi-speaker dialogue (`Jordan Smith`, `Sarah Jenkins`, `Alex Chen`, `Marcus Vance`)
   - 8 tracked action items (with owner attribution, time estimates, and Jira keys `AGILE-1001` through `AGILE-1008`)
   - Accepted coach topics and cross-sprint active insights
4. **Preserves** notification settings and integration connection config (Slack Channel ID, Email sender) so you don't have to re-enter them between runs
5. **Reloads** the UI state — sprints list, action items, insights — so everything is fresh immediately

### Where It Lives

- A small **"Reset Demo Data"** button in the **header area** of the Retrospectives screen (next to the project dropdown or in the top-right corner)
- Styled as a subtle ghost/outline button with a `RotateCcw` icon so it doesn't distract during the demo but is easy to find between runs
- Clicking it shows a **confirmation dialog**: *"This will delete all retrospectives, action items, coach topics, and insights, and re-seed the sprint data. Notification settings will be preserved. Continue?"*

### Implementation Details

**Backend — IPC handler (`retro:invoke` → `demo.resetData`):**
- Reads current `notification_settings` from the projects table before reset
- Drops data from: `retro_tracked_actions`, `retro_proposals`, `retrospectives`, `coach_topic_outcomes`, `coach_topics`, `coach_insights`, `coach_slack_messages`
- Deletes and re-inserts all `sprint_snapshots` rows (5 mock sprints)
- Pre-populates completed retrospectives & transcripts for Sprints 20, 21, and 22
- Pre-populates tracked action items (`AGILE-1001` through `AGILE-1008`) with owners (`Alex Chen`, `Marcus Vance`, `Sarah Jenkins`, `Jordan Smith`) and estimate durations
- Pre-populates coach topics and active insights
- Deletes and re-inserts the default project, restoring saved `notification_settings`
- Resets `mock_jira_counter` back to 1009 for subsequent tickets

**Frontend — New method on `retroClient`:**
```typescript
async resetDemoData(): Promise<{ success: boolean }> {
  return this._invoke("demo.resetData", {});
}
```

**UI — Button in `RetrospectivesView.tsx` header:**
```tsx
<Button
  variant="ghost"
  size="sm"
  onClick={() => setShowResetConfirm(true)}
  className="h-7 text-xs gap-1.5 text-muted-foreground hover:text-destructive"
>
  <RotateCcw size={13} />
  Reset Demo Data
</Button>
```

### Demo Workflow

1. **Before first demo run:** Click "Reset Demo Data" to ensure clean slate
2. **Run through the full demo** (Acts 1–6)
3. **Between demo runs:** Click "Reset Demo Data" again — everything resets in ~1 second without restarting the app
4. **Notification settings persist** so Slack/Email config doesn't need to be re-entered

## Potential Judge Questions & Answers

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| "How does it connect to Slack?" | "We use MCP (Model Context Protocol) — a standardized way for AI agents to call external tools. The Slack MCP server handles sending DMs and channel messages." |
| "Is the data stored locally?" | "Yes, everything — transcripts, sprint data, action items, coach memory — is stored in a local SQLite database. Nothing leaves the machine unless you explicitly send a Slack or email notification." |
| "What LLM does it use?" | "It's model-agnostic. You can use a local Qwen 7B model for fully offline operation, or connect to cloud providers like Google Gemini for richer analysis." |
| "How does topic suggestion work?" | "The coach ingests sprint metrics (velocity, blockers, burndown), open action items from past sprints, and historical retro outcomes. It uses this context to generate 3–5 prioritized topics with rationale for each." |
| "Can this work with other project management tools?" | "The architecture uses MCP, which means adding Jira, Linear, or Asana integration is a matter of connecting the right MCP server. The action item tracking already has a mock Jira ticket export." |
| "What's the learning loop?" | "After every retro, the coach evaluates which suggested topics were actually discussed and how deeply. Over time, it adjusts confidence and priority — if a topic gets ignored twice, it escalates. If a topic leads to improvement, it marks it resolved." |
